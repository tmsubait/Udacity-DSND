#### Project Motivation

This is the Blog Post Project for the Data Scientist ND. We will be applying CRISP-DM approach to the TMDb movie dataset. This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies regarding the following: budget, revenue, user rating, vote, genre and release year. It covers the period from 1960 to 2015.

The libraries used in this project include pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.

Business Understanding
We will try to answer the following three questions:

Which genres are the most popular?
Which genres are associated with the highest revenues?
What movie properties have highest impact on revenue?
